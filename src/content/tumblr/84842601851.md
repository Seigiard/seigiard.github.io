# Summer Nights

Summer lovin’ had me a blast  
Summer lovin’, happened so fast  
I met a girl crazy for me  
I met a boy, cute as can be

Summer days driftin’ away,  
To uh-oh those summer nights  
Tell me more, tell me more,  
Did you get very far?  
Tell me more, tell me more,  
Like, does he have a car?

She swam by me, she got a cramp  
He went by me, got my suit damp  
I saved her life, she nearly drowned  
He showed off, splashing around  
Summer sun, something’s begun,  
But uh-oh those summer nights

Tell me more, tell me more,  
Was it love at first sight?  
Tell me more, tell me more,  
Did she put up a fight?  
Took her bowlin’ in the Arcade  
We went strollin’, drank lemonade  
We made out under the dock  
we stayed up until ten o'clock

Summer fling don’t mean a thing,  
But uh-oh those summer nights  
Tell me more, tell me more,  
But you don’t gotta brag  
Tell me more, tell me more,  
Cause he sounds like a drag

He got friendly, holdin’ my hand  
Well she got friendly, down in the sand  
He was sweet, just turned eighteen  
Well she was good, you know what I mean

Summer heat, boy and girl meet,  
But uh-oh those summer nights  
Tell me more, tell me more,  
How much dough did he spend?  
Tell me more, tell me more,  
Could she get me a friend?

It turned colder, that’s where it ends  
So I told her we’d still be friends  
Then we made our true love vow  
Wonder what she’s doin’ now

Summer dreams ripped at the seams,  
But oh, those summer nights
