…And when ye come, and all the flowers are dying And I am dead, as dead
I well may be Ye’ll come and find the place where I am lying And kneel
and say an Ave there for me And I shall hear, though soft you tread
above me And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be For you shall bend and
tell me that you love me And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me
