                    <p>Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you.</p>

<p>Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you.</p>

<p>On the day that you were born
The angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue.</p>

<p>That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around.
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you.</p>
