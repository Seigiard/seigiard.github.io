                    <p>…And when ye come, and all the flowers are dying
And I am dead, as dead I well may be
Ye’ll come and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an Ave there for me
And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be
For you shall bend and tell me that you love me
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me</p>
