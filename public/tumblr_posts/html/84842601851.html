<p>Summer lovin&rsquo; had me a blast<br/>
Summer lovin&rsquo;, happened so fast<br/>
I met a girl crazy for me<br/>
I met a boy, cute as can be</p>

<p>Summer days driftin&rsquo; away,<br/>
To uh-oh those summer nights<br/>
Tell me more, tell me more,<br/>
Did you get very far?<br/>
Tell me more, tell me more,<br/>
Like, does he have a car?</p>

<p>She swam by me, she got a cramp<br/>
He went by me, got my suit damp<br/>
I saved her life, she nearly drowned<br/>
He showed off, splashing around<br/>
Summer sun, something&rsquo;s begun,<br/>
But uh-oh those summer nights</p>

<p>Tell me more, tell me more,<br/>
Was it love at first sight?<br/>
Tell me more, tell me more,<br/>
Did she put up a fight?<br/>
Took her bowlin&rsquo; in the Arcade<br/>
We went strollin&rsquo;, drank lemonade<br/>
We made out under the dock<br/>
we stayed up until ten o'clock</p>

<p>Summer fling don&rsquo;t mean a thing,<br/>
But uh-oh those summer nights<br/>
Tell me more, tell me more,<br/>
But you don&rsquo;t gotta brag<br/>
Tell me more, tell me more,<br/>
Cause he sounds like a drag</p>

<p>He got friendly, holdin&rsquo; my hand<br/>
Well she got friendly, down in the sand<br/>
He was sweet, just turned eighteen<br/>
Well she was good, you know what I mean</p>

<p>Summer heat, boy and girl meet,<br/>
But uh-oh those summer nights<br/>
Tell me more, tell me more,<br/>
How much dough did he spend?<br/>
Tell me more, tell me more,<br/>
Could she get me a friend?</p>

<p>It turned colder, that&rsquo;s where it ends<br/>
So I told her we&rsquo;d still be friends<br/>
Then we made our true love vow<br/>
Wonder what she&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; now</p>

<p>Summer dreams ripped at the seams,<br/>
But oh, those summer nights</p>
