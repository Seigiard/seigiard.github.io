Allegedly, a Pan Am 727 flight waiting for start clearance in Munich
overheard the following: Lufthansa (in German): “Ground, what is our
start clearance time?” Ground (in English): “If you want an answer you
must speak in English.” Lufthansa (in English): “I am a German, flying a
German airplane, in Germany. Why must I speak English?” Unknown voice
from another plane (in a beautiful British accent): “Because you lost
the bloody war.”
